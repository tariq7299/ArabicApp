# Frontend

## GLOBAL  
- Use prettier and test it
- Use lint and test it  
- Find a better wat to @import _variables.scss file into your scss fieles, like iam using the full relative path !! and i believe that there is a better way using `vite` or something

## NavBar  
- Crop logo only form the logo image nested inside the navbar
- Change the burger toggle icon to be black and bolder (You can't style it more you need to change the icon compleetely)
- Create the navbar expanding and collapsing transition to be just like british councel navbar
- Put the correct menue items with the correct font
